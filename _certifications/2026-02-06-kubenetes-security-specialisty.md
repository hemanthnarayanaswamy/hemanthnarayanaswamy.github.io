## Why I Pursued It

Achieving the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate certification was part of my goal to formalize the cloud design work I’d been doing in client projects. I wanted a structured way to validate architecture best practices, cost optimization, and operational excellence.

## Preparation Journey

1. **Weeks 1-2 — Core Services**: Reviewed EC2, S3, IAM, and networking fundamentals. Built small labs to get comfortable with VPC peering, NAT gateways, and security groups.
2. **Weeks 3-4 — Managed Services**: Focused on RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda, and API Gateway. Replicated existing workloads I’d delivered at work to map theory to practice.
3. **Weeks 5-6 — Reliability & Security**: Studied Well-Architected Framework whitepapers, practiced designing multi-AZ and multi-region failover strategies.
4. **Weeks 7-8 — Mock Exams**: Took practice tests, analyzed incorrect answers, and re-built weak areas. Documented each session in a learning journal.

## Key Takeaways

- Translating real workloads into exam scenarios made the concepts stick.
- The Well-Architected Framework is a powerful checklist for both exams and production design reviews.
- Automation (CloudFormation/Terraform) accelerates experimentation and reinforces best practices.
